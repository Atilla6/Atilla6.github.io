# How special is consciousness? 


**My thoughts on consciousness in Blindsight by Peter Watts**

When we think about aliens, we typically don't think about microbes or plants.
We like to think about small green dudes who are far smarter than we could imagine. 
But what if alien life was different than any of that?

Blindsight by Peter Watts explores the idea that consciousness is a phase of evolution.
In the book, we see that the human brain is actually moving away from consciousness. 
This is shown by our ability to do things with absolutely no recollection of doing them.
Similar to how you might drive home one night and only after you arrive do you question if any of the lights were green.

This raises the question, is consciousness beneficial? 
Does being actively aware of what you are doing provide any benefit?
In my work, I find that the best way to solve a problem is to step away from it.
By stepping away you let the subconscious work out the solution and when you sit back down, the answer seems obvious. 
With the recent boom in AI, it is becoming more clear that maybe consciousness doesn't play as large a part in problem-solving as we thought.
In Blindsight we encounter an alien race that has evolved past consciousness. They no longer are aware of themselves. 
They have no feelings or emotions, they are purely reactionary beings. The humans want nothing to do with a race with no consciousness.
This fact is shown by our treatment of animals back on Earth. Without consciousness, aliens seem boring and predictable.

Is consciousness something to be protected?
On Earth, we are at the top of the food chain, so it is natural to believe that aliens are just stronger versions of ourselves. 
But what if we were to encounter aliens that lack consciousness? Would we view them as weak or would we think ourselves weak?
Maybe it really is impossible to colonize the stars when we are ruled by emotion.
